## Demo Application
I will uploading progress video for each implementation and added on features
#Implementation #0:
Add an in-built loader animation, and integrated the API call manually by converting Json to Model Class Recipe by taking the raw data as input and returning a Recipe object. In short, I created a method to return the list of Recipe objects, by mapping the data from API to a class, pass it as a factory to a function that convert the iterable data to a list of objects.
